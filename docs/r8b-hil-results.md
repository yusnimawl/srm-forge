# R8b control HIL results

## Bring-up

Firmware project: PlatformIO 6.2.0, teensy 6.0.0, ststm32 20.0.0. Both environments compile in the modes ad7606+encoder and internal+ad2s1210 (internal+both also checked). Each firmware only answers HELLO with BUILD_INFO.

Bench (2026-10-21, modes ad7606 + encoder, hysteresis reference controller, analytic motor; boards not wired to each other):

- Nucleo-H723ZG: ST-LINK V3 (VID 0483 PID 374E), VCP on COM6. `build_and_flash(upload=True)` flashed through OpenOCD (programming and verify OK). Controller firmware: flash 9380 B (0.9 %), RAM 1236 B (0.4 %).
- Teensy 4.1: COM4 (VID 16C0 PID 0483). The first `teensy-cli` upload failed with "error writing to Teensy"; a retry a few seconds later succeeded (no button press). Emulator firmware: flash code 10404 B + data 3016 B (`teensy_size`).
- HELLO at 921600 baud on COM6 and over USB serial on COM4, decoded BUILD_INFO (protocol, board, current_sense, position, dac, firmware_hash):
  - COM6: (1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0x1986e876), the controller, as expected.
  - COM4: (1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0x1986e876), the emulator, as expected.
  - The hash equals the build's `firmware_hash`.
- First attempt on COM6 got no reply. Read through OpenOCD: PLL1 and the bus dividers were as configured, but USART3 BRR was 339, i.e. a 312 MHz kernel clock. The stm32cube framework carries its own `stm32h7xx_hal_conf.h` with `HSE_VALUE` 25 MHz, which the HAL library builds use instead of `hil/controller/stm32h7xx_hal_conf.h`, so the HAL computed the clock for 25 MHz. Fixed with `-DHSE_VALUE=8000000UL` in the controller `build_flags`; the reply then arrived.
